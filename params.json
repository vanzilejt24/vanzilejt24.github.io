{"name":"Jon VanZile's Project 2 Site Of Individual Proportions!","tagline":"vanzilejt24's site","body":"### Welcome to my Github page. Everything is on fire. This is fine.\r\n\r\n##Project Three!\r\nFor this project I created a JSP Note Sheet, reformed my resume into a technical resume (100% more technical than before), created a space invaders-like clone in Python using the Pygame library, and created a JSP / SQLite Data Base that stores armor components for a video game called Fallout 4.\r\n\r\n###InvadersFrom.py\r\n[Marshall Ehlinger](https://github.com/MEhlinger) had demonstrated a simple game written in Python, using the Pygame library. He offered to let any of his peers collaborate on the project. This sounded pretty appealing to me as I knew a little Python and zero about Pygame. The end result is terribly simple, but it was a fun experience. Most of the coding we do in the class-setting is instruction based so this was challenging simply because I was left to trouble shoot most of my problems by myself. At first I made some pixels move around a screen, then I learned to make things happen when I pressed a key. Very advanced stuff. Then, I stumbled onto [piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com). This site allowed me to make my own primitive pixel art. Using the skeletons of some Pygame examples floating around I eventually made a simple game where the player can move in two dimensions, fire a missile, tally a score, and die if the player is hit by an enemy projectile. Here you can see the archaic art assets I created. Here and Here you can see screenshots of the game running.\r\n\r\n###Power Armor Data Base\r\nThis is a JSP / SQLite Data Base that will allow the user to catalogue any pieces of Power Armor he/she finds while traveling throughout the nuclear wasteland that is Fallout 4. Why would someone need to catalogue their Power Armor components? I don't know. It's pretty basic.\r\n\r\n##Project 2\r\nFor this project team 2 (possibly referred to as Team Rocket) completed Part 1 of the IBM Master The Mainframe challenge, participated in the 2015 StateFarm Coding Competition (Colton achieved a modicum of success here, I did not) and hung some stuff up on a bulletin board. We also completed the MySQL tutorial on code academy and created a Linux System Administrator note sheet. Individually we each (hopefully) made our own program that combined Java and MySQL to communicate with a MySQL database. Cool stuff, right? Right?!\r\n\r\n### My Vehicle Registry Thing!\r\nNot to be content with merely using employees and storing their characteristics in a database, I took the bold approach of using vehicles and storing their characteristics in a database! Bold move Cotton. The basic CRUD functionality is there. I attempted to add two unique methods to the program, one which would truncate the table, effectively deleting all records; and the other is to sort the records based on user defined criteria. The latter doesn't quite work, while the former certainly does. The query to sort the records is being passed to the DB (I think), but I am implementing something wrong as far as displaying it is concerned.\r\n\r\n### Cowsay and fortune\r\nBecause I wanted to -- I installed Cowsay and fortune on our team webserver. When ever someone SSH's into the server a cow will present itself and offer moderately interesting information. I did this because. Just, because. I did have to meddle with a script as the root user to make it work, but it wasn't technically complicated.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author of this site is me, Jon VanZile. That is to say that the author is just Jon VanZile; not me AND Jon VanZile. And even further than that, I can only lay claim to the words on this site; the skeleton of it was provided by some guy named github. The other members of my group are Austin Swebilius, Jon Matson, and Colton Burdick.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
