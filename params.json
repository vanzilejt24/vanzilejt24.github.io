{"name":"Jon VanZile's Project 2 Site Of Individual Proportions!","tagline":"vanzilejt24's site","body":"### Welcome to my Github page. Everything is on fire.\r\nFor this project team 2 (possibly referred to as Team Rocket) completed Part 1 of the IBM Master The Mainframe challenge, participated in the 2015 StateFarm Coding Competition (Colton achieved a modicum of success here, I did not) and hung some stuff up on a bulletin board. We also completed the MySQL tutorial on code academy and created a Linux System Administrator note sheet. Individually we each (hopefully) made our own program that combined Java and MySQL to communicate with a MySQL database. Cool stuff, right? Right?!\r\n\r\n### My Vehicle Registry Thing!\r\nNot to be content with merely using employees and storing their characteristics in a database, I took the bold approach of using vehicles and storing their characteristics in a database! Bold move Cotton. The basic CRUD functionality is there. I attempted to add two unique methods to the program, one which would truncate the table, effectively deleting all records; and the other is to sort the records based on user defined criteria. The latter doesn't quite work, while the former certainly does. The query to sort the records is being passed to the DB (I think), but I am implementing something wrong as far as displaying it is concerned.\r\n\r\n### Cowsay and fortune\r\nBecause I wanted to -- I installed Cowsay and fortune on our team webserver. When ever someone SSH's into the server a cow will present itself and offer moderately interesting information. I did this because. Just, because. I did have to meddle with a script as the root user to make it work, but it wasn't technically complicated.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author of this site is me, Jon VanZile. That is to say that the author is just Jon VanZile; not me AND Jon VanZile. And even further than that, I can only lay claim to the words on this site; the skeleton of it was provided by some guy named github. The other members of my group are Austin Swebilius, Jon Matson, and Colton Burdick.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
